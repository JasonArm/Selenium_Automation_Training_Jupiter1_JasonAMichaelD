# Selenium Automation Training

The purpose of this repo is to provide post-classroom training, mentoring and experience to those new to automation
## Steps
- Mentor
  - **<u>Fork** this git repo and name it **Selenium_Automation_Training_**{Mentor}_{Trainee} _(This should be done by the mentor)_
```e.g. Selenium_Automation_Training_JasonA_FredB```
  - Invite the trainee to the **forked** repo  

- Trainee
  - The trainee then clones the repo on their local machine
  - And completes 1 or more of the exercises _(Exercises don't have to completed in one go)_
  - The trainee commits their code on a new branch. ```e.g. dev/FredB_exercise1```
  - The trainee pushes their branch back to github
  - Then submits a Pull-Request for the Mentor to review _(notifying the Mentor to expect a pull request)_  

- Mentor
  - The mentor then reviews the pull request and leaves comments
  - If rework is required then the Trainee can make changes and commit them to the original branch
  - Then push these change back to github, for further review
  - When both are happy - the trainee can move on to further exercises or another project :smile:
